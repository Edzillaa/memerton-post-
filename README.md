# Create memes people *definitely* want to see.
Honestly, you're the funniest person like, ever. You should *definitely* make internet jokes with this app.

# This is how to make memes:
1) Start app and log in, we want your deets dude.
2) Find an image you like (try not to steal it, it's tacky).
3) Go to our dope *create* page and upload your new fave image.
4) I feel like I don't *need* to say this but, add text to your photo. Make it funny or "The Prez" is gonna delete your ass.
5) Post your new, rad, funny internet joke and enjoy the slow trickle of dopamine.
6) like (or dislike) other people's memes! They also need that sweet dopamine and I sure didn't do all that math to not sort stuff.
